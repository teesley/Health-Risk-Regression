# Health-Risk-Regression
Machine Learning model built using SKLearn which utililizes the Random Forest Classification algorithm to predict maternal health risk based on various health related features. The model is able to predict maternal health risk with an accuracy of 87%. 

Additionally, I deployed my model using Flask and built the webpage with HTML and CSS to turn it into an interactive webpage. This allows a user to interact with the webpage, enter their information, and get a prediction on their maternal health risk. At the moment, I have not yet hosted the website but I am considering doing so in the future. In the meantime, if you would like to test out its functionality for yourself, ensure you have all the dependencies installed and run the command "python3 app.py" or "python app.py" depending on your version of python.
